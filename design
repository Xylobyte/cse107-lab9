To get a good word difference program I am going to approach it like the following:

Ask user for file names
Open files and handle any exceptions with opening them
Read the files line by line
for each line compare each character and make note of the differences in a list
when outputting the differences print the tag along with the line
Maybe: print '^' carrot symbol underneath the characters found to be different
